## Notes

- `fonts_custom` are bitmap font tables generated from the **Ubuntu Mono** typeface
  (Copyright Canonical Ltd.), distributed under the **Ubuntu Font Licence 1.0**. The UFL
  text is at `fonts_custom/LICENSE`; attribution is in `fonts_custom/CUSTOM.md`.
- `st25dv` is the STM32Cube BSP component driver. Its `LICENSE.md` (BSD-3-Clause) was
  restored from the upstream repository; the driver source headers reference it.
- Waveshare (`e-Paper`, `Config`, `GUI`) and `miniz` carry their grants inline in the
  source rather than as separate LICENSE files.
